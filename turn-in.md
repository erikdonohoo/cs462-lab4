# Project 4: MapReduce

1. The command line was faster because it wasn't ever dealing with super huge data nor did it have to deal with the overhead of booting up some large machines and connecting them together.
2. [Mapper.py](mapper.py) & [Reducer.py](reducer.py)
3. The results I got seemed to look good.  I ran it on a book in the gutenberg project and everything was ordered and looking correct
